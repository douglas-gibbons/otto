ʘttʘ is a web application used to control switches and view sensor output using MQTT over websockets. Connection settings are configured through the web interface, and stored in the browser's [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API).

There are also features for more general publish/subscribe of MQTT topics.
